# Mattermost - Direct Poll Slash Command

**TODO**: Build a Mattermost (https://www.mattermost.com) integration that uses a Slash Command (https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html), the Mattermost API (https://api.mattermost.com/), Message Attachments (https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/message-attachments.html), and Interactive Message Buttons (https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/interactive-message-buttons.html) to poll users in a Team or Channel via direct message.

The design specification/use case for the slash command can be found here: [Specification/Use Case](SPECIFICATION.md)
